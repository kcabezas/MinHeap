# MinHeap
Program to implement heap and priority queue.

Things to note:

-This was a homework assignment for the class CS 1332 Data Structures & Algorithms, which I took in Fall 2015.

-All the classes in this repository were provided by the teacher & teaching assistants of the class. MinHeap.java and MinPriorityQueue.java came with blank public methods which needed to be filled in with the appropriate code.
